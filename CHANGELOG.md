        - Now `vco` can be `box`ed
        - enabled more short-name geographical anchors
        - generic blocks can be made rectangular
        - mid-way lateral anchors for all blocks, as well as up/down
        - renamed converters anchors (old ones retained for backward compatibility)
        - new ac/ac blocks, both single- and three-phase
    - Added double gate MOS transistors (by Romano Giannetti)

* Version 1.5.0 (2022-04-22)

    In this version, several internal changes have been included in order to streamline and organize better the components and to change the management of color. The changes are pretty deep and subtle, so a bug or unexpected behaviour is always possible. You can use the 1.4.6 rollback point in case of trouble, but be sure to report any bug.

    - Added connectors shapes, and included the BNC into that class; thanks to [Alexander Sauter for suggesting them and helping in the design](https://github.com/circuitikz/circuitikz/issues/611)
    - Added nullator and norator shapes, suggested by [user atticus-sullivan on GitHub](https://github.com/circuitikz/circuitikz/issues/615)

    - Fixed a problem with generic tunable arrows, noticed thanks to [this question on TeX.SX](https://tex.stackexchange.com/q/637182/38080)

    Internal changes:

    - Added a generic drawing function for shapes, which are now drawn always in background
    - Added a hook system to be able to change component drawing settings per-shape, per-class or globally
    - All the 250+ shapes are now "protected" by possible external arrow and arced corners parameters
    - Completely changed the management of the shapes' color, thanks to [GitHub user muzimuzhi](https://github.com/circuitikz/circuitikz/issues/605)

* Version 1.4.6 (2022-02-04)

    A nasty bug fix and some hack to avoid that some global Ti*k*Z option spill into the shapes. To better solve that problem, some risky changes are due, so this release will be also a rollback point for compatibility reasons.

    - Fix bug with legacy transmission lines in `overlay`s ([noticed by Benedikt Wilde](https://github.com/circuitikz/circuitikz/issues/604))
    - Robustify some shapes: do not let arrows option pass to the inner drawing (see [here](https://tex.stackexchange.com/a/632084/38080) and [here](https://matrix.to/#/!NuxCISwYQJuyWwNsEI:matrix.org/$vQO6luq1F66LJ79dERmaqKI46qMBcjStqYCPi725uZE?via=matrix.org&via=2krueger.de&via=im.f3l.de))
    - Add warning about global draw options in the manual
    - Fixes in documentation: hyperlink the index again, cite new recovery point, remove some legacy construct
    - Added 1.4.6 rollback point

* Version 1.4.5 (2021-12-06)

    Important fix for ConTeXt users, thanks to @TeXnician for reporting.

    - Fixed an incompatibility introduced with subcircuits that made compilation in ConTeXt fail
    - Added `\ctikzflip[x][y]` utility macros for ConTeXt too
    - Fixed stray characters in some Ti*k*Z environment

* Version 1.4.4 (2021-10-31)

    Normal maintenance release; minor bugs fixed, a new component and a new option. No Halloween component, sorry...

    - Added a laser diode component ([contributed by Andr√© Alves](https://github.com/circuitikz/circuitikz/issues/591))
    - Add the `override source vif` option and better describe source's voltage positioning in the manual
    - fix `nobase` option with IGBT family (noticed by [user hinata exc on Stack Eschange](https://tex.stackexchange.com/q/619334/38080))
    - fix  a problem with [legacy open voltage label position](https://github.com/circuitikz/circuitikz/issues/584)

* Version 1.4.3 (2021-09-06)

    Minor release, mainly a single bugfix.

    - added hidden anchors of `ooosource` to the manual
    - fix a bug in anchors of `ooosource` (they did not respect class scaling)
    - faster `use fpu reciprocal` (thanks to Henri Menke)

* Version 1.4.2 (2021-07-26)

    This is a minor release, containing just a new component and a
    small set of fixes (mainly in the documentation).

    - add the `cpe` (constant phase element)
    - correct minor errors in the manual (capacitor's fill, spaces)
      and the code.

* Version 1.4.1 (2021-07-14)

    This version has an important bug fix for label positioning when once-relative style coordinates are used (the ones with a single `+`, like `+(1,1)`.
    Moreover, the possibility to have voltage, current and flow labels *without* the symbols (arrows, etc) has been added, which greatly simplify some kind of personalization of these elements.

    - Added the generic tunable macro
    - Added `no v symbols` (and also for `i` and `f`), thanks to a [head-up by user judober on GitHub](https://github.com/circuitikz/circuitikz/issues/567), see also [issue 448](https://github.com/circuitikz/circuitikz/issues/448)
    - Fixed [label position for +() style coordinates](https://github.com/circuitikz/circuitikz/issues/569)

* Version 1.4.0 (2021-07-06)

    The main news is that *package rollback* for `circuitikz` has been implemented (LaTeX-only, of course).
    Additionally, a small but important change in the path (`to`) construction that should fix some warning from Ti*k*Z
    and give better line joins in wire corners.

    - bump version to 1.4.0
    - implement the version rollback: time travel to 0.4!
    - remove a wrong movement in the path construction (potentially dangerous)

* Version 1.3.9 (2021-06-27)

    Bugfix release: `open poles opacity` was not working in most of the cases.

    - minor fixes to the manual
    - fix bug with `open poles opacity`; see [this question by Florian H.](https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/602251/circuitikz-redefine-open-nodes-fill-key-to-fill-none-so-that-open-circuit) for details.

* Version 1.3.8 (2021-06-15)

    The big news of this release is the ability to selectively draw the pins of the integrated circuit and mux-demuxes symbols.

    - Add `draw only pins` feature to `dipchip` and `qfpchip`, thanks to [Jonathan P. Spratte](https://github.com/circuitikz/circuitikz/pull/550), and a similar option to control the pins of `muxdemux`
    - Make `dipchip` and `qfpchip` respect `no input leads` option
    - Several corrections to the manual

* version 1.3.7 (2021-06-01)

    Minor release, mainly documentation upgrades.

    - New options for the line thickness, rotation and size of symbols drawn in sources
    - New tutorial:  drawing a circuit around an operational amplifier
    - Documentation fixes and small enhancements

* version 1.3.6 (2021-05-09)

    Mainly a bugfix release; fixing a bug in the `l2` stacked labels means that old constructs that were failing silently can give an error now. Sorry.
    To compensate, I added stacked annotation (for symmetry).

    - Added stacked annotations for symmetry with stacked labels.
    - Fixed a bug in the plotting of `inst amp ra` terminals.
    - Fixed a bug in managing stacked labels (`l2=...`); possibly it will be mildly backward-incompatible (please see the manual about incompatible changes)

* Version 1.3.5 (2021-05-02)

    Power electronics devices are the main characters in this release: PUT, GTOs, a new style for thyristors, and a photovoltaic module.
    Additionally, an **experimental** support for subcircuits has been added;
    it could change in the future.
    Fixed a nasty bug in rotary switches "in" anchor positioning in some cases.

    - Added support for creating and using sub-circuits
    - Added UJT transistors and GTO devices ([suggested by JetherReis](https://github.com/circuitikz/circuitikz/issues/522))
    - Added (as an option) a different, more compact style for thyristor-type devices.
    - Added a photovoltaic module ([suggested by Andr√© Alves](https://github.com/circuitikz/circuitikz/issues/524))
    - Added a DC/DC converter block for symmetry ([suggested by Pratched](https://github.com/circuitikz/circuitikz/issues/529))
    - Added the possibility to change the waveforms shown in the oscilloscope ([suggested by Mario Tafur](https://tex.stackexchange.com/q/595062/38080))
    - In the manual, separate the component usage chapter from the big component list
    - Fix wrong rotary switch "in" anchors for switches with more than 180 degrees coverage ([see bug](https://github.com/circuitikz/circuitikz/issues/532))

* Version 1.3.4 (2021-04-20)

    New things, like configurable modifier thickness, ferroelectric devices, and several transistor tweaks.
    Importantly, a bug that hindered compatibility with the internal Ti*k*Z `circuits` library (introduced in 1.3.3) has been fixed.

    - Added separate configuration for the line thickness of resistors, capacitors, and inductors modifiers
    - Added ferroelectric capacitors and ferroelectric gate MOS/FETs ([suggested by Mayeul Cantan](https://github.com/circuitikz/circuitikz/issues/515))

    - Added a "centergap" anchor for transistors
    - Added the option "nogate" to the `hemt` symbol
    - Fixed a bug in thermistors not respecting their class line thickness
    - Fixes in the manual (copy and paste of snippets without numbers, correct old usage of `siunitx`, factor out repetitions in the preamble; [thanks to Ulrike Fischer](https://tex.stackexchange.com/a/57160/38080).
    - Fixed a bug introduced in 1.3.3 that would reduce compatibility with the `circuits` internal library; [reported by JetherReis]( https://github.com/circuitikz/circuitikz/issues/519))

* Version 1.3.3 (2021-04-04)

    Several usability additions in this version, and one small fix that could
    change the look of your circuit (without affecting correctness). Some of the
    arrow shapes are now configurable.

    Do not use this version, there is a bug with the new "label distance" key.

    - Added options to fine-tune the position of labels and annotations
    - Added options to change arrow tips on variable resistors, inductors and
      capacitors as well as in potentiometers
    - Added options to change arrow tips on switches
    - Added anchors to inductance to add core lines

    Bugfix release.

    - The recent temporary changes to TikZ to v3.1.8a revealed a problem in corner cases with `circuitikz` that should be fixed (thanks to Henri Menke)

* Version 1.2.6 (2020-12-16)

    The highlight of this release is the option to draw circles around transistors; moreover, a handful of new component and several bug fixes.

    - added option to have transistors with circles, suggested by user `@myzinsky`
    - added closed position for normally open button and the other way around (suggested by user `@septatrix`)

* Version 1.2.4 (2020-10-04)

    - several documentation enhancment
    - added a couple of block elements: allpass filter, generic two-sides block (suggested by user `@myzinsky`)

    - Block anchors: add border anchors for round elements and deprecate old 1, 2, 3, 4 anchors
    - Fixed some bipole border size to avoid overlapping labels; document it

* Version 1.2.2 (2020-07-15)

    Bug-fix release: coordinate name leakage. The node and coordinate names are global; the internal coordinate names have been made stronger.

* Version 1.2.1 (2020-07-06)

    Several changes, both internal and user-visible. These are quite risky, although they *should* be backward-compatible (if the circuit code is correct).

    From the user point of view:
    - there is now a new style of voltages ("raised American")
    - a powerful mechanism for customize voltages, current and flows has been added.

    The internal changes are basically the re-implementation of the macros that draw the path elements (`to[...]`), which have been completely rewritten. Please be sure to read the possible incompatibilities in the manual (section 1.9).

    - Added access to voltages, currents and flows anchors
    - Added "raised american" voltage style
    - Rewrite of the path generation macros
    - Several small bugs fixed (no one ever used some "f^>" options...)

* Version 1.2.0 (2020-06-21)

    In this release, the big change is the rewriting of the voltages output routine. Now all voltage options (american, european, and straight) take into account the shape (square border) of the component. The adjusting parameters are now (at least for passive elements) acting in similar way for all the options, too.

    - Bumped version number to 1.2 (potentially incompatible changes!)
    - Added 1.1.2 checkpoint
    - New path-style not, buffer, and Schmitt logic ports
    - New tutorial (using the "inline not" component)
    - Voltage output routine rewrite; now it takes into account the shape of the component also for "american" and "straight" voltages
    - Several fixes in the logic ports: fixed IEEE `invschmitt` name, added symmetry to the three-style shorthands for the ports, and so on
    - Fixed a gross bug in square poles anchor borders
    - Fixed size of not circles in flip-flops (based on logic ports style)
    - Fixed the order of initial options, to avoid "european" overwriting single options

* Version 1.1.2 (2020-05-17)

    - Blocks and component for three-phase networks (3-lines wire, AC/DC and DC/AC converters blocks and grid node block) added by user `@olfline` on GitHub
    - added transformer sources with optional vector groups for three-phase networks by `@olfline` on Github
    - added subsections to the examples
    - fixed position of american voltages on open circuits (suggested by user `@rhandley` on GitHub)

* Version 1.1.1 (2020-04-24)

    One-line bugfix release for the IEEE ports "not" circle thickness

* Version 1.1.0 (2020-04-19)

    Version bumped to 1.1 because the new logic ports are quite a big addition: now there is a new style for logic ports, conforming to IEEE recommendations.

    Several minor additions all over the map too.

    - added IEEE standard logic ports suggested by user Jason-s on GitHub
    - added configurability to european logic port "not" output symbol, suggested by j-hap on GitHub
    - added `inerter` component by user Tadashi on GitHub
    - added variable outer base height for IGBT, suggested by user RA-EE on GitHub
    - added configurable "+" and "-" signs on american-style voltage generators
    - text on amplifiers can be positioned to the left or centered

* Version 1.0.2 (2020-03-22)

    - added Schottky transistors (thanks to a suggestion by J√©r√¥me Monclard on GitHub)
    - fixed formatting of `CHANGELOG.md`

* Version 1.0.1 (2020-02-22)

    Minor fixes and addition to 1.0, in time to catch the freeze for TL2020.

    - add v1.0 version snapshots
    - added crossed generic impedance (suggested by Radv√°nyi Patrik Tam√°s)
    - added open barrier bipole (suggested by Radv√°nyi Patrik Tam√°s)
    - added two flags to flip the direction of light's arrows on LED and photodiode (suggested by karlkappe on GitHub)
    - added a special key to help with precision loss in case of fractional scaling (thanks to AndreaDiPietro92 on GitHub for noticing and reporting, and to Schr√∂dinger's cat for finding a fix)
    - fixed a nasty bug for the flat file generation for ConTeXt

* Version 1.0 (2020-02-04)

    And finally... version 1.0 (2020-02-04) of `circuitikz` is released.

    The main updates since version 0.8.3, which was the last release before Romano started co-maintaining the project, are the following --- part coded by Romano, part by several collaborators around the internet:

    - The manual has been reorganized and extended, with the addition of a tutorial part; tens of examples have been added all over the map.
    - Around 74 new shapes where added. Notably, now there are chips, mux-demuxes, multi-terminal transistors, several types of switches, flip-flops, vacuum tubes, 7-segment displays, more amplifiers, and so on.
    - Several existing shapes have been enhanced; for example, logic gates have a variable number of inputs, transistors are more configurable, resistors can be shaped more, and more.
    - You can style your circuit, changing relative sizes, default thickness and fill color, and more details of how you like your circuit to look; the same you can do with labels (voltages, currents, names of components and so on).
    - A lot of bugs have been squashed; especially the (very complex) voltage direction conundrum has been clarified and you can choose your preferred style here too.

A detailed list of changes can be seen below.

* Version 1.0.0-pre3 (not released)

    - Added a Reed switch
    - Put the copyright and license notices on all files and update them
    - Fixed the loading of style; we should not guard against reload

* Version 1.0.0-pre2 (2020-01-23)

    **Really** last additions toward the 1.0.0 version. The most important change is the addition of multiplexer and de-multiplexers; also added the multi-wires (bus) markers.

    - Added mux-demux shapes
    - Added the possibility to suppress the input leads in logic gates
    - Added multiple wires markers
    - Added a style to switch off the automatic rotation of instruments
    - Changed the shape of the or-type american logic ports (reversible with a flag)

* Version 1.0.0-pre1 (2019-12-22)

    Last additions before the long promised 1.0! In this pre-release we feature a flip-flop library, a revamped configurability of amplifiers (and a new amplifier as a bonus) and some bug fix around the clock.

    - Added a flip-flop library
    - Added a single-input generic amplifier with the same dimension as "plain amp"
    - Added border anchors to amplifiers
    - Added the possibility (expert only!) to add transparency to poles (after a suggestion from user @matthuszagh on GitHub)
    - Make plus and minus symbol on amplifiers configurable
    - Adjusted the position of text in triangular amplifiers
    - Fixed "plain amp" not respecting "noinv input up"
    - Fixed minor incompatibility with ConTeXt and Plain TeX

* Version 0.9.7 (2019-12-01)

    The important thing in this release is the new position of transistor's labels; see the manual for details.

    - Fix the position of transistor's text. There is an option to revert to the old behavior.
    - Added anchors for adding circuits (like snubbers) to the flyback diodes in transistors (after a suggestion from @EdAlvesSilva on GitHub).

* Version 0.9.6 (2019-11-09)

    The highlights of this release are the new multiple terminals BJTs and several stylistic addition and fixes; if you like to pixel-peep, you will like the fixed transistors arrows. Additionally, the transformers are much more configurable now, the "pmos" and "nmos" elements have grown an optional bulk connection, and you can use the "flow" arrows outside of a path.

    Several small and less small bugs have been fixed.

    - Added multi-collectors and multi-emitter bipolar transistors
    - Added the possibility to style each one of the two coils in a transformer independently
    - Added bulk connection to normal MOSFETs and the respective anchors
    - Added "text" anchor to the flow arrows, to use them alone in a consistent way
    - Fixed flow, voltage, and current arrow positioning when "auto" is active on the path
    - Fixed transistors arrows overshooting the connection point, added a couple of anchors
    - Fixed a spelling error on op-amp key "noinv input down"
    - Fixed a problem with "quadpoles style=inner" and "transformer core" having the core lines running too near

* Version 0.9.5 (2019-10-12)

    This release basically add features to better control labels, voltages and similar text "ornaments" on bipoles, plus some other minor things.

    On the bug fixes side, a big incompatibility with ConTeXt has been fixed, thanks to help from `@TheTeXnician` and `@hmenke` on `github.com`.

    - Added a "midtap" anchor for coils and exposed the inner coils shapes in the transformers
    - Added a "curved capacitor" with polarity coherent with "ecapacitor"
    - Added the possibility to apply style and access the nodes of bipole's text ornaments (labels, annotations, voltages, currents and flows)

* Version 0.9.4 (2019-08-30)

    This release introduces two changes: a big one, which is the styling of the components (please look at the manual for details) and a change to how voltage labels and arrows are positioned. This one should be backward compatible *unless* you used `voltage shift` introduced in 0.9.0, which was broken when using the global `scale` parameter.

    The styling additions are quite big, and, although in principle they are backward compatible, you can find corner cases where they are not, especially if you used to change parameters for `pgfcirc.defines.tex`; so a snapshot for the 0.9.3 version is available.

    - Fixed a bug with "inline" gyrators, now the circle will not overlap
    - Fixed a bug in input anchors of european not ports
