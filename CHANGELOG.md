<!--- CircuiTikz - Changelog --->
The major changes among the different circuitikz versions are listed here. See <https://github.com/circuitikz/circuitikz/commits> for a full list of changes.

* Version 1.1.2 (unreleased)

    - bumped version number
    - Blocks and component for three-phase networks (3-lines wire, AC/DC and DC/AC converters blocks and grid node block) added by user `@olfline` on GitHub
    - added transformer sources with optional vector groups for three-phase networks by `@olfline` on Github

* Version 1.1.1 (2020-04-24)

    One-line bugfix release for the IEEE ports "not" circle thickness

* Version 1.1.0 (2020-04-19)

    Version bumped to 1.1 because the new logic ports are quite a big addition: now there is a new style for logic ports, conforming to IEEE recommendations.

    Several minor additions all over the map too.

    - added IEEE standard logic ports suggested by user Jason-s on GitHub
    - added configurability to european logic port "not" output symbol, suggested by j-hap on GitHub
    - added `inerter` component by user Tadashi on GitHub
    - added variable outer base height for IGBT, suggested by user RA-EE on GitHub
    - added configurable "+" and "-" signs on american-style voltage generators
    - text on amplifiers can be positioned to the left or centered

* Version 1.0.2 (2020-03-22)

    - added Schottky transistors (thanks to a suggestion by Jérôme Monclard on GitHub)
    - fixed formatting of `CHANGELOG.md`

* Version 1.0.1 (2020-02-22)

    Minor fixes and addition to 1.0, in time to catch the freeze for TL2020.

    - add v1.0 version snapshots
    - added crossed generic impedance (suggested by Radványi Patrik Tamás)
    - added open barrier bipole (suggested by Radványi Patrik Tamás)
    - added two flags to flip the direction of light's arrows on LED and photodiode (suggested by karlkappe on GitHub)
    - added a special key to help with precision loss in case of fractional scaling (thanks to AndreaDiPietro92 on GitHub for noticing and reporting, and to Schrödinger's cat for finding a fix)
    - fixed a nasty bug for the flat file generation for ConTeXt

* Version 1.0 (2020-02-04)

    And finally... version 1.0 (2020-02-04) of `circuitikz` is released.

    The main updates since version 0.8.3, which was the last release before Romano started co-maintaining the project, are the following --- part coded by Romano, part by several collaborators around the internet:

    - The manual has been reorganized and extended, with the addition of a tutorial part; tens of examples have been added all over the map.
    - Around 74 new shapes where added. Notably, now there are chips, mux-demuxes, multi-terminal transistors, several types of switches, flip-flops, vacuum tubes, 7-segment displays, more amplifiers, and so on.
    - Several existing shapes have been enhanced; for example, logic gates have a variable number of inputs, transistors are more configurable, resistors can be shaped more, and more.
    - You can style your circuit, changing relative sizes, default thickness and fill color, and more details of how you like your circuit to look; the same you can do with labels (voltages, currents, names of components and so on).
    - A lot of bugs have been squashed; especially the (very complex) voltage direction conundrum has been clarified and you can choose your preferred style here too.

A detailed list of changes can be seen below.

* Version 1.0.0-pre3 (not released)

    - Added a Reed switch
    - Put the copyright and license notices on all files and update them
    - Fixed the loading of style; we should not guard against reload

* Version 1.0.0-pre2 (2020-01-23)

    **Really** last additions toward the 1.0.0 version. The most important change is the addition of multiplexer and de-multiplexers; also added the multi-wires (bus) markers.

    - Added mux-demux shapes
    - Added the possibility to suppress the input leads in logic gates
    - Added multiple wires markers
    - Added a style to switch off the automatic rotation of instruments
    - Changed the shape of the or-type american logic ports (reversible with a flag)

* Version 1.0.0-pre1 (2019-12-22)

    Last additions before the long promised 1.0! In this pre-release we feature a flip-flop library, a revamped configurability of amplifiers (and a new amplifier as a bonus) and some bug fix around the clock.

    - Added a flip-flop library
    - Added a single-input generic amplifier with the same dimension as "plain amp"
    - Added border anchors to amplifiers
    - Added the possibility (expert only!) to add transparency to poles (after a suggestion from user @matthuszagh on GitHub)
    - Make plus and minus symbol on amplifiers configurable
    - Adjusted the position of text in triangular amplifiers
    - Fixed "plain amp" not respecting "noinv input up"
    - Fixed minor incompatibility with ConTeXt and Plain TeX

* Version 0.9.7 (2019-12-01)

    The important thing in this release is the new position of transistor's labels; see the manual for details.

    - Fix the position of transistor's text. There is an option to revert to the old behavior.
    - Added anchors for adding circuits (like snubbers) to the flyback diodes in transistors (after a suggestion from @EdAlvesSilva on GitHub).

* Version 0.9.6 (2019-11-09)

    The highlights of this release are the new multiple terminals BJTs and several stylistic addition and fixes; if you like to pixel-peep, you will like the fixed transistors arrows. Additionally, the transformers are much more configurable now, the "pmos" and "nmos" elements have grown an optional bulk connection, and you can use the "flow" arrows outside of a path.

    Several small and less small bugs have been fixed.

    - Added multi-collectors and multi-emitter bipolar transistors
    - Added the possibility to style each one of the two coils in a transformer independently
    - Added bulk connection to normal MOSFETs and the respective anchors
    - Added "text" anchor to the flow arrows, to use them alone in a consistent way
    - Fixed flow, voltage, and current arrow positioning when "auto" is active on the path
    - Fixed transistors arrows overshooting the connection point, added a couple of anchors
    - Fixed a spelling error on op-amp key "noinv input down"
    - Fixed a problem with "quadpoles style=inner" and "transformer core" having the core lines running too near

* Version 0.9.5 (2019-10-12)

    This release basically add features to better control labels, voltages and similar text "ornaments" on bipoles, plus some other minor things.

    On the bug fixes side, a big incompatibility with ConTeXt has been fixed, thanks to help from `@TheTeXnician` and `@hmenke` on `github.com`.

    - Added a "midtap" anchor for coils and exposed the inner coils shapes in the transformers
    - Added a "curved capacitor" with polarity coherent with "ecapacitor"
    - Added the possibility to apply style and access the nodes of bipole's text ornaments (labels, annotations, voltages, currents and flows)
    - Added the possibility to move the wiper in resistive potentiometers
    - Added a command to load and set a style in one go
    - Fixed internal font changing commands for compatibility with ConTeXt
    - Fixed hardcoded black color in "elko" and "elmech"

* Version 0.9.4 (2019-08-30)

    This release introduces two changes: a big one, which is the styling of the components (please look at the manual for details) and a change to how voltage labels and arrows are positioned. This one should be backward compatible *unless* you used `voltage shift` introduced in 0.9.0, which was broken when using the global `scale` parameter.

    The styling additions are quite big, and, although in principle they are backward compatible, you can find corner cases where they are not, especially if you used to change parameters for `pgfcirc.defines.tex`; so a snapshot for the 0.9.3 version is available.

    - Fixed a bug with "inline" gyrators, now the circle will not overlap
    - Fixed a bug in input anchors of european not ports
    - Fixed "tlinestub" so that it has the same default size than "tline" (TL)
    - Fixed the "transistor arrows at end" feature, added to styling
    - Changed the behavior of "voltage shift" and voltage label positioning to be more robust
    - Added several new anchors for "elmech" element
    - Several minor fixes in some component drawings to allow fill and thickness styles
    - Add 0.9.3 version snapshots.
    - Added styling of relative size of components (at a global or local level)
