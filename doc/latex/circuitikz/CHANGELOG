CircuiTikz - Changelog

* Version 0.3.0
	- fixed gate node for a few transistors
    - added mixer
    - added fully differential op amp (by Kristofer M. Monisit)
    - now general settings for the drawing of voltage can be overridden for specific components
    - made arrows more homogeneous (either the current one, or latex' bt pgf)
    - added the single battery cell
    - added fuse and asymmetric fuse
    - added toggle switch
    - added varistor, photoresistor, thermocouple, push button
    - added thermistor, thermistor ptc, thermistor ptc
    - fixed misalignment of voltage label in vertical bipoles with names
    - added isfet
    - added noiseless, protective, chassis, signal and reference grounds (Luigi «Liverpool»)

* Version 0.2.4	
	- added square voltage source (contributed by Alistair Kwan)
	- added buffer and plain amplifier (contributed by Danilo Piazzalunga)
	- added squid and barrier (contributed by  Cor Molenaar)
	- added antenna and transmission line symbols contributed by Leonardo Azzinnari
	- added the changeover switch spdt (suggestion of Fabio Maria Antoniali)
	- rename of context.tex and context.pdf (thanks to Karl Berry)
	- updated the email address
    - in documentation, fixed wrong (non-standard) labelling of the axis in an example (thanks to prof. Claudio Beccaria)
    - fixed scaling inconsistencies in quadrupoles    
    - fixed division by zero error on certain vertical paths
    - introduced options straighlabels, rotatelabels, smartlabels

* Version 0.2.3
	- fixed compatibility problem with label option from tikz
	- Fixed resizing problem for shape ground
	- Variable capacitor
	- polarized capacitor
	- ConTeXt support (read the manual!)
	- nfet, nigfete, nigfetd, pfet, pigfete, pigfetd (contribution of Clemens Helfmeier and Theodor 
Borsche)
	- njfet, pjfet (contribution of Danilo Piazzalunga)
	- pigbt, nigbt
	- *backward incompatibility* potentiometer is now the standard resistor-with-arrow-in-the-middle; the old potentiometer is now known as variable resistor (or vR), similarly to variable inductor and variable capacitor
	- triac, thyristor, memristor
	- new property "name" for bipoles
	- fixed voltage problem for batteries in american voltage mode
	- european logic gates
	- *backward incompatibility* new american standard inductor. Old american inductor now called "cute inductor"
	- *backward incompatibility* transformer now linked with the chosen type of inductor, and version with core, too. Similarly for variable inductor
	- *backward incompatibility* styles for selecting shape variants now end are in the plural to avoid conflict with paths
	- new placing option for some tripoles (mostly transistors)
	- mirror path style

		
* Version 0.2.2 - 20090520
    - Added the shape for lamps.
	- Added options \texttt{europeanresistor}, \texttt{europeaninductor}, \texttt{americanresistor} and \texttt{americaninductor}, with corresponding styles.
	- FIXED: error in transistor arrow positioning and direction under negative \texttt{xscale} and \texttt{yscale}.

* Version 0.2.1 - 20090503
	- Op-amps added
	- added options arrowmos and noarrowmos, to add arrows to pmos and nmos

* Version 0.2 - 20090417
First public release on CTAN
   	- *Backward incompatibility*: labels ending with \texttt{:}\textit{angle} are not parsed for positioning anymore.
	- Full use of \TikZ\ keyval features.
	- White background is not filled anymore: now the network can be drawn on a background picture as well.
	- Several new components added (logical ports, transistors, double bipoles, \ldots).
	- Color support.
	- Integration with {\ttfamily siunitx}.
	- Voltage, american style.
	- Better code, perhaps. General cleanup at the very least.

* Version 0.1 - 2007-10-29
First public release
