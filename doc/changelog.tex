here. See \url{https://github.com/mredaelli/circuitikz/commits} for a
full list of changes.

\begin{itemize}

\item
  Version 0.6 (unreleased)

  \begin{itemize}
  \itemsep1pt\parskip0pt\parsep0pt
  \item
    Add new sources voosource and ioosource (double zero-style)
  \item
    All diode can now drawn in a stroked way, just use globel option
    ``strokediode'' or stroke instead of full/empty, or D-
  \item
    Improved Shape of Diodes:tunnel diode, Zener diode, schottky diode
    (bit longer lines at cathode)
  \item
    Reworked igbt: New anchors G,gate and new L-shaped form Lnigbt,
    Lpigbt
  \item
    Improved shape of all fet-transistors and mirrored p-chan fets as
    default, as pnp, pmos, pfet are already. This means a
    backward-incompatibility, but smaller code, because p-channels
    mosfet are by default in the correct direction(source at top). Just
    remove the `yscale=-1' from your p-chan fets at old pictures.
